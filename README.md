# PizzaSales-Analysis-Dashboard
Hello


Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze reports


• Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers


• Used different types of customized visualization (Bar chart, Line Chart, Donut chart, Funnel chart, Slicers, Filters, Page Navigation etc)



This is a Pizza Sales Report Month wise sale comparison Dashboards : SQL / Excel / Power BI.

This dashboard includes: 

sum of revenue

sum of quantity

sum of orders

sum of Average Order Value

sum of amount by month

sum of % sales by category, size

sum of quantity by payment mode

Best & Worst etc.


Whenever I click on the dashboard, it will change completely according to the click.

I have shown the rest through Bar chart, Line Chart, Donut chart, Funnel chart, Slicers, Filters, Page Navigation etc

If you think that adding something else to it could have made it look better, then let me know so that I can improve it.
